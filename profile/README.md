# Librecat : open source applications for libraries 

LibreCat is a group of library developers and enthusiasts who meet at library conferences such as [ELAG](https://elag.org) and [SWIB](http://swib.org) and enjoy sharing code to process library (meta)data.

This group was formed in 2013 and have many many free and open tools available. This project page provide an overview of all the tools we share with the rest of the world.

We created this tool mainly because they helped us in our own projects. We hope the tools can help you in your projects, but we are not a compagny or have any funding for any helpdesk or extensive support. The code is provided as is, if there any questions please ask the developers for assistence.

Cheers from LibreCaters:
